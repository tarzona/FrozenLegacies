## Here are 5 papers to get acquainted with the SPRI-NSF-TUD Campaign

1) Schroeder et al. 2019 (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1821646116) - this paper gives a great introduction about the archival SPRI-NSF-TUD Campaign and modern airborne radio-echo soundings in Antarctica like the 2016 MCoRDS dataset.
2) Millar et al. 1981 (https://www.nature.com/articles/292441a0) - A quick overview of Amplitude Scopes, "A-Scopes", which measures the returned power in dB from the SPRI-NSF-TUD dataset. 
3) Drewry, Jordan, and Janowski 1982 (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/measured-properties-of-the-antarctic-ice-sheet-surface-configuration-ice-thickness-volume-and-bedrock-characteristics/975F6ACAD14490A976953AD87759A5FE?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark) - This is an explanation of how they were able to map the airplane navigation for the SPRI-NSF-TUD dataset in Antarctica.
4) Bingham and Siegert 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2008.10.014) - this paper talks about how they derived basal roughness from the SPRI-NSF-TUD dataset in East and West Antarctic Ice Sheet. 
5) Karlsson et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-3333-2024) - this paper talks about the same archival dataset, but in Greenland. Even though both polar regions have the same survey type, each dataset have their own challenges.
