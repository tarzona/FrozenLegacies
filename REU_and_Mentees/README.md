## REU and Mentees Folder

This folder is for REU students and mentees working with Angelo T. regarding the SPRI-NSF-TUD dataset. __For Mentees__ that are not in REU, __please click the appropriate folder name that represents the semester and year you are working with Angelo and Dr. Chu__ regarding the SPRI-NSF-TUD dataset. __For REU students__, please continue reading this README file. 

## Current projects we have right now 

## Scientific Projects

1. Semi-automatically picking unpicked gaps between flight tracks of Z-scopes in Ross Ice Shelf  
   _Need a Windows machine for this project_

2. Semi-automatically picking and calibrating gaps between flight tracks of A-scopes in Ross Ice Shelf  
   _Windows and Apple machines work for this project_

## Technical Projects

3. Finding lost A-scopes and Z-scopes within Ross Ice Shelf from radarfilm.studio and verifying that these lost scopes have the appropriate CBD  
   _This will require knowledge of Bash coding and permission from the Stanford Radioglaciology group_

4. Creating a catalog through Microsoft Excel of all scientific journals published between the 1960s and early 2000s regarding the SPRI-NSF-TUD dataset
